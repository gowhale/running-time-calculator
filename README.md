If I want to run a 5KM run in 24 minutes, what average pace will I need to aim for? What time should I be achieveing when I reach the second KM? 

I'm aiming to create Go script that will take in 2 inputs: 
1. DISTANCE 
1. TIME

Then will output the following: 
1. an average pace to aim for
1. KM by KM times to achieve

Just to practice using Go and maybe help me get a running PB ðŸ‘€
